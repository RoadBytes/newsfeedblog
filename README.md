My first Interview!

After my first developer interview, I had an "inspiration" to make a toy blog app to see if I could implement a *News Feed* feature where the News Feed would display the last six "things" I did.

### Here are a few specs I think I remember:
* The feed could include blog posts, or tweets, or other media I could have out there.
* It would be on the home page on the bottom
* It would consist of the latest things I've posted

To save time I stole bits of [this guys implementation (Leonard Garvey)](https://twitter.com/lgarvey) of a [Rails Blog in 15 minutes app.](https://reinteractive.net/posts/32-ruby-on-rails-3-2-blog-in-15-minutes-step-by-step) 

Then, I had to do some sleuthing for a Twitter Rails gem.  I found [this](https://github.com/sferik/twitter) and it was super cool to use.

### Man!  I learned a whole lot just playing with this application.
* First off, Twitter API is pretty cool and I pulled the tweets from an app I made on my Twitter home page.
